# chatbot-task

Your assignment is to create a simple Python function. We've designed this task to be achievable within 1-2 hours.

## Task Description
You are to implement a function that accepts a single text string as input and returns another text string as output:

```python
def answer_question(user_question: str) -> str:
   # Your solution here
```

This function will serve as the "backend" for a chatbot designed for retail investors.

To simplify the task, the user query will **always** adhere to the following conditions (no need to check for errors):

- The question will always pertain to a **single** company.
  - The company will be explicitly mentioned in the query (e.g. `cocacola`) and is guaranteed to be present in the dataset.
- The question will always relate to a specific full fiscal year (i.e., only `fiscal_period == "FY"`, no questions about quarters, etc.).
   - The year will be explicitly mentioned in the query as the only four digit number in the query.
   - Information about this year is guaranteed to be present in the dataset.
- The subject of the user's question will always be one of the following five topics (i.e., the user will never ask about any other topic):
   - `Total Revenue`
   - `Net Income / (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders`
   - `Price to Earnings (P/E)`
   - `Dividend Yield`
   - `Return on Equity (ROE)`
 
## Example Questions and Answers

Notice that keyword search will not work, for example "revenue" is not mentioned in the question that seeks an answer about revenue. Consider allowing your program to use ChatGPT to assist with the control flow.

## Guidelines for Software Design

- We recommend using Python [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library for loading and processing the CSVs.
- We recommend using the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart). Please ensure not to include your API key in the code.
   - You are welcome to utilize any helpful libraries, such as [Marvin](https://www.askmarvin.ai/), [LMQL](https://lmql.ai/), [Microsoft Guidance](https://github.com/microsoft/guidance), [guardrails](https://shreyar.github.io/guardrails), [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html), or others. However, using the OpenAI API directly is also perfectly acceptable.
- Please place your solution in a public or private Github repository, as per your preference. We would expect to find one (or multiple) `.py` or `.ipynb` files with your source code in it. Don't copy-paste your code to chat applications.
- Don't modify the CSV files. Your program should read the original files and process them, don't use something like Excel to manually edit the data in the data files.
- Don't copy-paste the data from CSV to a data structure in your source code. Your program should read the original files and process them, don't manually search for the data yourself.
- It's not mandatory to encapsulate all of your code within a function; you can place some code outside of it as well, for example by using Python classes and methods.
- Feel free to develop in Jupyter notebooks, if you prefer.
   - It would be beneficial if you included a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate any exploratory work you undertake.
